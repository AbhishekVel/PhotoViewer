# PhotoViewer
Photo Viewing application that utlizes a LinkedList Data Structure to maximize efficiency for the viewing, adding, and removal of photos in the application.

A personal project created simply for the educational purpose of learning the applications of the linked list data structure.

Benefits of using linked list for this project:

O(1) to add a new photo to the beggining or end of the list
O(n) to add a new photo in the list (anywhere but the beggining and end)

O(1) to delete a photo located in the beggining or end
O(n) to delete a photo located anywhere in the list

Usage of .next or .prev in order to efficiently transition to the previous/next image.


GUI:
Used external libraries for the GUI to make the User Interface aesthetically pleasing.
