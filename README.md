# PhotoViewer
Photo Viewing application that utlizes a LinkedList Data Structure to maximize efficiency for the viewing, adding, and removal of photos in the application.

A personal project created simply for the educational purpose of learning the linked list data structure through a real world application use.

Benefits of using linked list for this project:

O(n) to add a new photo in the list (best case being O(1) for a head or tail).

O(n) to delete a photo located anywhere in the list (base case being O(1) for a head or tail)

Usage of .next or .prev in order to efficiently transition to the previous/next image.


GUI:
Used a JavaFX GUI builder to reduce the time needed to create the GUI.


A few pictures of the application:
